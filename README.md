**Required Feature Checklist: **



1. Login/register path with Firebase 
2. Settings Screen. The three behaviors we implemented are Sound Alerts, Notifications, Dark Mode
3. Non-default fonts and colors used 

Two Major elements used: 



1. Core Data- On home page, the items added to the grocery list are stored even when closing out of the app  
2. User profile path using camera and photo library- can change the profile picture using the live camera or from a photo library  

 

Minor Elements used: 



1. Three additional view types including segmented controllers and bar buttons (bar buttons are used in the tab bar at the bottom of the screen and the segmented controller is used to switch between the login and the create account page, switches used on the settings page)
2. Table View- the table view is used on the home page to display the grocery list items and their respective quantities
3. Alerts, Scroll Views, and User defaults- alerts the user when an item is successfully added to the grocery list and a scroll view is used to display the quick add items to the grocery list. User defaults are used in the settings page. 
4. Frameworks Implemented: Local notifications (the user can turn on local notifications for when an item is added to the grocery list), Gesture Recognition (when the keyboard is open on the screen, user can tap to close it), Animation (the logo on the get started page slides in from the right), Core Audio (when the setting is turned on, adding an item to the grocery list creates a sound)
